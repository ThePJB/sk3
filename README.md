Needs level
level editor is kind of unfathomable maybe I should just do text again

structure: 'worlds' unlocked when prev world is completed
1 new mechanic per world or theme

and 

simulation: tiles and aray of entities
entities need to interpolate


move on snow, kick up snow
sliding ice, sliding sound ssssss

reflections ez

gameplay simulation, should be pretty ez too

undos etc


rectangles top left bottom right etc, maybe it would work


i could refactor it into a god object and split it into many pieces with methods basically
